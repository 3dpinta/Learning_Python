    "# Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "Up until now, we've written functions that encapsulate code for easy re-use. We can pass data to our functions, which may operate on them and return results. However, we have been limited in the types of data we can work with. This section introduces the concept of object-oriented programming (often referred to as OOP).\n",
    "\n",
    "An *object* bundles together data and functions. For example, a Python [List](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) is an object. It contains data (its elements) and functions (such as `sort`, `append` and `count`)."

    "## Defining Objects\n",
    "When we define our own objects, we will write a *class* containing data and functions. Let's start with a simple example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Rectangle:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, width=1, height=1):\n",
    "        self.width = width\n",
    "        self.height = height\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.width * self.height\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We've defined a `Rectangle` object, which has two pieces of data that it keeps track of: `width` and `height`. It also has a function `get_area` that we can invoke, in much the same way we would create a list and call its `append` function. We can create a `Rectangle` in much the same way we might create a list:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rect = Rectangle(2, 3)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `__init__` function is a special function that is executed when we create an object. Its purpose is to perform any *initialization* (hence its name) that ought to occur when the object is being created. In our case, we initialize the width and height of our `Rectangle`. Note that a parameter of our `__init__` method is `self`, which refers to the object we are creating.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call functions that our `Rectangle` has associated with it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> rect.get_area()\n",
    "6\n",
    "```"

    "## Inheritance\n",
    "Working with objects provides powerful abstractions and an incredible amount of code re-use. For example, let's implement a `Square` class. One way to write `Square` would be the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Square:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side=1):\n",
    "        self.side = side\n",
    "        \n",
    "    def get_area(self):\n",
    "        return self.side ** 2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we can take advantage of the code we've already written for `Rectangle`. We know that a square is a rectangle. Inheritance exactly follows this *is a* relationship. We can thus write our `Square` class to *inherit from* our `Rectangle` class:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Square(Rectangle):\n",
    "    def __init__(self, side=1):\n",
    "        super().__init__(side, side)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we're saying that a `Square` *is a* `Rectangle`. This means that `Square` *inherits* all of the data and functions inside `Rectangle`. Let's make sure:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> my_square = Square(2)\n",
    ">>> my_square.get_area()\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> my_square.width\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We're able to re-use all the code that we already wrote for `Rectangle` so that we don't have to re-implement our `get_area` function. We can also show that our square is a rectangle, but our rectangle is not a square:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> isinstance(my_square, Square)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(my_square, Rectangle)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(rect, Square)\n",
    "False\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(rect, Rectangle)\n",
    "True\n",

    "## Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall a few operators in Python: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, and so on. As you know, these operators behave differently depending on context:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 2 + 3\n",

    "\n",
    ">>> 'a' + 'b'\n",
    "'ab'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 'a' - 'b'\n",
    "Traceback (most recent call last):\n",
    "  File \"<stdin>\", line 1, in <module>\n",
    "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What's really going on here is the subtraction operator is a *function* that takes two parameters. The string class does not implement the subtraction function, so the operand type `str` is unrecognized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Implementing an operator inside your own class is called *overloading* that operator. Here we will define a `Rational` class that keeps track of rational numbers. We'll overload several common operators so we can perform common functions on our `Rational`s.\n",
