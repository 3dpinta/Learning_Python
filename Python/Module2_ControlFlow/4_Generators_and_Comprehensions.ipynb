Instead, it stores the instructions for generating each of its members in sequence, and stores its iteration state - meaning that the generator will know if it has generated its second member, and will thus generate its third member the next time it is iterated on. The whole point of this is that you can use a generator to produce a long sequence of items, without having to store them all in memory."
