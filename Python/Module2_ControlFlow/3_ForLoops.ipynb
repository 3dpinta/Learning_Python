    "## For-Loops\n",
    "A \"for-loop\" allows you to iterate over a collection of items, and execute a block of code once for each iteration. The general syntax for a \"for-loop\" is:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "for <var> in <iterable>:\n",
    "    block of code\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Where `<var>` is any valid variable-identifier and `<iterable>` is any **iterable**.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "**Definition**: An **iterable** is any Python object capable of returning its members one at a time. Common examples of iterables include lists, tuples, strings, and dictionaries. Formally, an iterable is any Python object with an `__iter__()` method or with a `__getitem__()` method that implements `Sequence` semantics.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "The for-loop behaves as follows:\n",
    "- Request the next member of the iterable.\n",
    "- If the iterable is empty, exit the for-loop without running the enclosed code block.\n",
    "- If the iterable did produce a member, assign that member to `<var>` (if `<var>` was not previously defined, it becomes defined). \n",
    "- Execute the enclosed block of code.\n",
    "- Go back to the first step.\n",
    "\n",
    "To be concrete, let's consider the example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for item in [1, 3, 5]:\n",
    "    total = total + item\n",
    "\n",
    "print(total)  # `total` has the value 1 + 3 + 5 = 9\n",
    "# `item` is still defined here, and holds the value 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This code will perform the following steps:\n",
    "1. Define the variable `total`, and assign it the value `0`\n",
    "2. Iterate on the list, producing value `1`, define the variable `item` and assign it the value `1`\n",
    "3. Assign `total` the value `0 + 1`\n",
    "4. Iterate on the list, producing the value `3` and assigning it to `item`\n",
    "5. Assign `total` the value `1 + 3`\n",
    "6. Iterate on the list, producing the value `5` and assigning it to `item`\n",
    "7. Assign `total` the value `4 + 5`\n",
    "8. Iterate on the list. Having reached its end, a `StopIteration` signal it raised by the list, and the for-loop sequence is exited.\n",
    "9. Print the value of `total` (9)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Potential Pitfall\n",
    "Note that the variable `item` will persist after the for-loop block is exited. It will reference the last value from the for-loop iteration (in this case `item` has the value 5). That being said, **you should not write code that depends on the iterate-variable, outside of the context of the for-loop**. In the case that you try to loop over an *empty* iterable, the iterate-variable is never defined:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for x in []:         # the iterable is empty - the iterate-variable `x` will not be defined\n",
    "    print(\"Hello?\")  # this code is never executed\n",
    "print(x)             # raises an error because `x` was never defined\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we are attempting to iterate over an empty list, `StopIteration` is raised immediately - before the variable `x` is even defined. Thus the code enclosed within the for-loop is never reached, and the subsequent `print(x)` statement will raise a `NameError`, because `x` was never defined!"

    "## \"Unpacking\" Iterables\n",
    "Suppose that you have three values stored in a list, and that you want to assign a distinct variable to each value. Given the lessons that we have covered thus far, you would likely write the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# simple script for assigning variables to contents of list\n",
    ">>> my_list = [7, 9, 11]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x = my_list[0]\n",
    ">>> y = my_list[1]\n",
    ">>> z = my_list[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides an extremely useful functionality, known as **iterable unpacking**, which allows us to write the simple, elegant code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# assigning variables to contents of a list using iterable unpacking\n",
    ">>> my_list = [7, 9, 11]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x, y, z = my_list\n",
    ">>> print(x, y, z)\n",
    "7 9 11\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That is, the Python interpreter \"sees\" the pattern of variables to the left of the assignment, and will \"unpack\" the iterable (which happens to be a list in this instance). It may not seem it from this example, but this is an *extremely* useful feature of Python that greatly facilitates the readability of code! \n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable unpacking is particularly useful in the context of performing for-loops over iterables-of-iterables. For example, suppose we have a list containing tuples of name-grade pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> grades = [(\"Ashley\", 93), (\"Brad\", 95), (\"Cassie\", 84)]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall from the preceding section that if we loop over this list, that the iterate-variable will be assigned to each of these tuples:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for entry in grades:\n",
    "    print(entry)\n",
    "```\n",
    "will print:\n",
    "```\n",
    "('Ashley', 93)\n",
    "('Brad', 95)\n",
    "('Cassie', 84)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It is likely that we will want to work with the student's name and their grade independently (e.g. use the name to access a log, and add the grade-value to our class statistics), thus we will need to index into `entry` twice to assign its contents to two separate variables. However, because each iteration of the for-loop involves an assignment of the form `entry = (\"Ashley\", 93)`, we can make use of iterable unpacking!\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# The first iteration of this for-loop performs\n",
    "# the unpacking assignment: name, grade = (\"Ashley\", 93)\n",
    "for name, grade in grades: \n",

    "    # name = \"Brad\",   grade = 95\n",
    "    # name = \"Cassie\", grade = 84\n",
    "    print(name)\n",
    "    print(grade)\n",
    "    print(\"\\n\")\n",
    "```\n",

    "Cassie \n",
    "84\n",
    "```\n",
    "This for-loop code is concise and supremely readable. It is highly recommended that you make use of iterable unpacking in such contexts.\n",
    "\n",
    "Iterable unpacking is not quite as simple as it might seem. What happens if you provide 4 variables to unpack into, but use an iterable containing 10 items? Although what we have covered thus far conveys the most essential use case, it is good to know that [Python provides an even more extensive syntax for unpacking iterables](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3132/#specification). We will also see that unpacking can be useful when creating and using functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",

Instead, it stores the instructions for generating each of its members in sequence, and stores its iteration state - meaning that the generator will know if it has generated its second member, and will thus generate its third member the next time it is iterated on.
