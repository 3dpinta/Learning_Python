    "- `<function name>` can be any valid variable name, and *must* be followed by parentheses and then a colon.\n",
    "- `<function signature>` specifies the input arguments to the function, and may be left blank (if the function does not accept any arguments).\n",
    "- The documentation string (commonly referred to as a *docstring*) may span multiple lines, and should indicate what the function's purpose is. It is optional.\n",
    "- `<encapsulated code>` can consist of general Python code.\n",
    "- `return` is used to indicate what object should be returned, whenever the function is called.\n",
