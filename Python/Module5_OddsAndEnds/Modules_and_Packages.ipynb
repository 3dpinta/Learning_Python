    "Our tour through the essentials of Python and NumPy required us to regularly make use of `import` statements. This allowed us to access the functions and objects that are provided by the standard library and by NumPy.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# accessing `defaultdict` from the standard library's `collections` package\n",
    "from collections import defaultdict\n",
    "\n",
    "# import the entire numpy package, giving it the alias 'np'\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite our regular use of the `import` statement, we have thus far swept its details under the rug. Here, we will finally pay our due diligence and discuss Python's import system, which entails understanding the way that code can be organized into modules and packages. Modules are individual `.py` files from which we can import functions and objects, and packages are collections of such modules. Detailing this packaging system will not only provide us with insight into the organization of the standard library and other collections of Python code, but it will permit us to create our own packages of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this section, we will demonstrate the process of installing a Python package to your system; supposing that you have written your own Python package, installing it enables you to import it anywhere on your system. Finally, we will provide a brief overview of the two most popular venues for hosting Python packages to the world at large: the Python Package Index (PyPI) and Anaconda.org.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [official Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) provides a nice overview of this material and dives into details that we will not concern ourselves with here. "
