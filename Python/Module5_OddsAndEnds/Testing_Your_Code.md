# Testing Your Code

As we become capable Python users, we will naturally find ourselves moving away from writing short, trivial programs in favor of creating useful projects. That being said, as our code becomes more complex, how will we know that it all works as expected? Obviously, one will naturally try out their project to verify its behavior. But how often will we test our projects this way; will it be every time we touch our code? Furthermore, will we run the same test every time, or are there several conditions under which we will run our code? Here, we will discuss the critically-important process of writing tests for Python code.

With great power comes great responsibility.
