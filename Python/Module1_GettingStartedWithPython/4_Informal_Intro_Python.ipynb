    "## Sequences Types\n",
    "Being able to work with sequences of objects/data is so important that it warrants us to take our first (relatively) deep dive into Python. The preceding reading introduced Python lists and strings, two important objects that are built-in to the Python language. Although quite distinct from one another in terms of what they can contain, **lists and strings are both types of sequences** - they store a finite collection of objects whose ordering matters (e.g. `\"cat\"` and `\"tac\"` should be considered distinct strings). As such, lists, strings, and the other sequence types in Python all share a common interface for allowing users to inspect, retrieve, and summarize their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Other types of sequences: tuples, numpy-arrays, byte-arrays\n",
    "The most common sequence type that we have yet discussed is the **tuple**. A tuple is very similar to a list, in that it can store a sequence of arbitrary objects (a mix of numbers, strings, lists, other tuples, etc.), however, **once a tuple is formed, it cannot be changed**. This is in stark contrast to a list, which has the \"append\" method to add objects to the end of the list, and whose individual members can be replaced. Also, where lists are indicated with square-brackets, tuples use round-brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the contents of a list can be changed\n",
    ">>> x = [1, \"moo\", None] \n",
    ">>> x[0] = 2\n",
    ">>> x\n",
    "[2, 'moo', None]\n",
    "\n",
    "# the contents of a tuple cannot be changed\n",
    ">>> y = (1, \"moo\", None)  # (a b, ...) creates a tuple\n",
    ">>> y[0] = 2\n",
    "TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That a tuple cannot be changed means that it is an *immutable* sequence type (more on this below), as are strings. Tuples generally consume less memory than do lists, since it is known that a tuple will not change in size. Furthermore, tuples come in handy when you want to ensure that a sequence of data cannot be changed by subsequent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays and byte-arrays are two other types of sequences in Python. You will likely not encounter the latter in this text.\n",

    "### Accessing members and subsequences within a sequence: `seq[index]` and `seq[start:stop:step]`\n",
    "It is critical to have a good grasp of how to access members and subsequences within a sequence, using indexing and slicing.\n",
    "#### Indexing\n",
    "Recall from the reading about strings that Python allows you retrieve members of a sequence by specifying the *index* of that member, which is the integer that uniquely identifies that member's position in the sequence. **Python implements 0-based indexing** for its sequences, and also permits the use of negative integers to count from the end of the sequence:\n",
    "```\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " | P | y | t | h | o | n |\n",
    " +---+---+---+---+---+---+\n",
    " 0   1   2   3   4   5   6\n",
    "-6  -5  -4  -3  -2  -1\n",
    "```\n",
    ">The first row of numbers gives the position of the indices 0â€¦6 in the string; the second row gives the corresponding negative indices. Each member's index corresponds to the edge  *left* of the member: 0-P, 1-y, ..., 5-n\n",
    "\n",
    "Given this indexing scheme, Python reserves the use of square brackets, when following a variable name or object, as the \"get-item\" syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = [1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    ">>> x[0]\n",
    "1\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x[-1]\n",
    "4\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> \"cat\"[2]\n",
    "'t'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### slicing\n",
    "In addition to accepting an integer as an index to a single member of a sequence, the \"get-item\" syntax can also accept the built-in `slice\"` object identify *subsequences* to be retrieved. A slice can be provided with a start-index, a stop-index, and a step-size, to specify the desired subsequence. The item at the start-index is *included* in the subsequence, wherease the item at the stop-index (if there is one) is *excluded*. Negative indices and step-sizes are valid too.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "\n",
    "# start:1, stop:4, step:1\n",
    ">>> x[slice(1, 4, 1)]\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# start:0, stop:-1, step:2\n",
    ">>> x[slice(0, -1, 2)]\n",
    "[0, 2, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Python also provides a sleeker syntax for slicing a sequence. When within the \"get-item\" square brackets, you can use colons to separate the start, stop, and step values for the slice:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using the colon-syntax to specify slicing\n",
    "# start:1, stop:4, step:1\n",
    ">>> x[1:4:1]\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this colon syntax for slicing is nearly ubiquitous in Python code, it is important to realize that this is merely \"syntactic sugar\", and that Python really just forming `slice` objects for you when you use it.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, the start-index is 0, the stop-index is `len(seq)`, and the step-size is 1. Python will revert to any these defaults either if you omit a value or specify the `None` object in the value's place. The second colon need not be included if you are relying on the step-1 default value:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# equivalent to: \n",
    "# start:0, stop:3, step:1\n",
    ">>> x[:3]\n",
    "[0, 1, 2]\n",
    "\n",
    "# equivalent to: \n",
    "# start:0, stop:5, step:1\n",
    ">>> x[:]\n",
    "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The one acception to these defaults is when a negative step-size is specified. In this case, the default start-value is -1, and the default stop-value is set to **include** the 0th element of the list. *There is no way to replicate this default stop-value using an integer*, since there is no index \"before\" 0:\n",
    "```python \n",
    "# start:`len(x)-1`, stop:**include the 0th element**, step:-1\n",
    ">>> x[::-1]\n",
    "[5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "# start:`len(x)-1`, stop:0, step:-1\n",
    "# note that the stop-value is *excluded* once again\n",
    ">>> x[:0:-1]\n",
    "[5, 4, 3, 2, 1]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> \n",
    "**Takeaway**: To \"slice\" a sequence is to retrieve a subsequence by specifying a start-index (included), a stop-index (excluded), and a step value. Negative values can be supplied for these, and default values are available as well. The common slicing syntax `x[start:stop:step]` is actually just a nice shorthand for using a `slice` object: `x[slice(start, stop, step)]`.  \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Handling out-of-bounds indices\n",
    "Attempting to get a member from a sequence using an out-of-bounds index will raise an `IndexError`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x[6]\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x[-7]\n",
    "IndexError: list index out of range\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **specifying an out-of-bounds start or stop value for a slice does not raise an error**. Instead, the nearest valid start/stop value is used instead:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x[:10000]\n",
    "[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-danger\"> \n",
    "**Warning**: The lack of bounds-checking for slices can be a major source for errors when starting out with Python - just because your code isn't raising an error does not mean that you have computed the correct start/stop values for your slice!\n",

    "Based on the following behavior, we can conclude that slicing a list does **not** produce a reference to the original list. Rather, slicing a list produces a copy of the appropriate subsequence of the list:\n",

    "x[0] = -1  # update one of the entries of the list that `x` references\n",
    ">>> x\n",

    ">>> y      # the list that `y` references was unaffected by the update\n",
