    "## Variables & Assignment\n",
    "Variables permit us to write code that is flexible and amendable to repurpose. Suppose we want write code that logs a student's grade on an exam. The logic behind this process should not depend on whether we are logging Brian's score of 92% versus Ashley's score of 94%. As such, we can utilize variables, say `name` and `grade`, to serve as placeholders for this information. In this subsection, we will demonstrate how to define variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `=` symbol represents the \"assignment\" operator. The variable goes to the left of `=`, and the object the variable is being assigned to goes to the right:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Brian\"  # the variable `name` is being assigned to the string \"Brian\"\n",
    "grade = 92      # the variable `grade` is being assigned to the integer 92\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attempting to reverse the assignment order (e.g. `92 = name`) will result in a syntax error. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> \n",
    "**Note**: When a variable is assigned to an object (like a number or a string), it is common to say that the variable **references** that object. That is, the variable `name` references the string `\"Brian\"`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable is referencing a value, you can use the variable elsewhere in your code as a placeholder:\n",

    "name = \"Brian\"\n",
    "failing = False\n",

    "In general, assigning a variable `b` to a variable `a` will cause the variables to reference the *same* object in the system's memory, and assigning `c` to `a` or `b` will simply have a third variable reference this same object. Then any change (a.k.a *mutation*)  of the object will be reflected in all of the variables that reference it (`a`, `b`, and `c`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, assigning two variables to identical, but *independent* lists means that a change to one list will not affect the other:\n",

    " \n",
    "We saw that a given instance of a list can have its value be changed (e.g. we appended the number 4 to the list), meaning that a list is an example of a **mutable** object. A Python integer, on the otherhand, is an example of an immutable object. Consider the following:\n",

Because Python integers are immutable, it is impossible to change the value of a given integer-object. To increase the value of `x` by 1 entails assigning `x` to a new variable altogether, leaving the value referenced by `y` unchanged. In effect, `x += 1` tells `x` to reference a completely new integer, `3`, and `y` continues to reference `2`.\n",
