    "- Become familiar with strings and their nuances.\n",
    "- Encounter 'slices' for accessing parts of sequences. (This is very important!)\n",
    "- Learn how to create lists of items.\n",
    "- Use a 'while-loop' to compute the first 6 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.\n",
    "- How to assign variables to values.\n",
    "- What makes a valid variable name.\n",
    "- What to expect when multiple variables reference the same object.\n",

    "## Variables & Assignment\n",
    "Variables permit us to write code that is flexible and amendable to repurpose. Suppose we want write code that logs a student's grade on an exam. The logic behind this process should not depend on whether we are logging Brian's score of 92% versus Ashley's score of 94%. As such, we can utilize variables, say `name` and `grade`, to serve as placeholders for this information. In this subsection, we will demonstrate how to define variables in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, the `=` symbol represents the \"assignment\" operator. The variable goes to the left of `=`, and the object the variable is being assigned to goes to the right:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "name = \"Brian\"  # the variable `name` is being assigned to the string \"Brian\"\n",
    "grade = 92      # the variable `grade` is being assigned to the integer 92\n",
    "```\n",
    "Attempting to reverse the assignment order (e.g. `92 = name`) will result in a syntax error. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\"> \n",
    "**Note**: When a variable is assigned to an object (like a number or a string), it is common to say that the variable **references** that object. That is, the variable `name` references the string `\"Brian\"`.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "Once a variable is referencing a value, you can use the variable elsewhere in your code as a placeholder:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "grade = 92\n",
    "name = \"Brian\"\n",
    "failing = False\n",
    "\n",
    "if grade < 60:\n",
    "    failing = True\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# writes: name | grade | passing-status\n",
    "# to the end of the file \"student_grades.txt\"\n",
    "with open(\"student_grades.txt\", mode=\"a\") as opened_file:\n",
    "    opened_file.write(f\"{name} | {grade} | {failing}\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Valid Names for Variables\n",
    "A variable name can only consist of alphanumeric characters (a-z, A-Z, 0-9) and the underscore symbol (`_`); a valid name *cannot* begin with a numerical value:\n",
    "- `var`: valid\n",
    "- `_var2`: valid\n",
    "- `ApplePie_Yum_Yum`: valid\n",
    "- `2cool`: **invalid** (begins with a numerical character)\n",
    "- `I.am.the.best`: **invalid** (contains `.`)"

    "#### Referencing a \"Mutable\" Object with Multiple Variables\n",
    "It is possible to assign variables to other, existing variables. Doing so will cause the variables to reference the same object:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> list1 = [1, 2, 3]  #  `list1` references [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> list2 = list1      #  `list2` and `list1` now both reference [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(list1)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> print(list2)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "What this entails is that these common variables will reference the *same instance* of the list. Meaning that if the list changes, all of the variables referencing that list will reflect this change:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> list1.append(4)  # append 4 to the end of [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> print(list1)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that `list2` is still assigned to reference the *same, updated* list as `list1`:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(list2)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In general, assigning a variable `b` to a variable `a` will cause the variables to reference the *same* object in the system's memory, and assigning `c` to `a` or `b` will simply have a third variable reference this same object. Then any change (a.k.a *mutation*)  of the object will be reflected in all of the variables that reference it (`a`, `b`, and `c`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, assigning two variables to identical, but *independent* lists means that a change to one list will not affect the other:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> list1 = [1, 2, 3]  #  `list1` references [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> list2 = [1, 2, 3]  #  `list2` references a *separate* list, whose value is [1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> list1.append(4)  # append 4 to the end of [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> print(list1)\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, 4]\n",

    "#### Dealing with Immutable Objects\n",
    " A *major exception* to the preceding discussion of referencing a single object with multiple variables is when one is working with an **immutable** object. \n",
    " \n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\"> \n",
    "**Definition**: An **immutable object** is a Python object, that, once defined, cannot have its value/state be changed without creating a new object altogether.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    " \n",
    "We saw that a given instance of a list can have its value be changed (e.g. we appended the number 4 to the list), meaning that a list is an example of a **mutable** object. A Python integer, on the otherhand, is an example of an immutable object. Consider the following:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 2\n",
    ">>> y = x    # assigns `y` to the integer 2\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> x += 1   # equivalent to `x = x + 1`\n",
    ">>> print(x)\n",
    "3\n",
    ">>> print(y) # `y` is unaffected by whatever happened to `x`\n",
    "2\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It may seem that `x` and `y` initially reference the same \"instance\" of `2`, and thus both should ultimately reference `3`. Because Python integers are immutable, it is impossible to change the value of a given integer-object. To increase the value of `x` by 1 entails assigning `x` to a new variable altogether, leaving the value referenced by `y` unchanged. In effect, `x += 1` tells `x` to reference a completely new integer, `3`, and `y` continues to reference `2`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some common immutable and mutable objects in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some immutable objects\n",
    " - numbers (integers, floating-point numbers, complex numbers)\n",
    " - strings\n",
    " - tuples \n",
    " - boolean values\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Some mutable objects\n",
    " - lists\n",

    " - numpy-arrays\n",
    " - instances of user-defined objects"
