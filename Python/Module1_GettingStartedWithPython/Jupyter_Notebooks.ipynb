    "## Notebook Cells \n",
    "Whereas a Python console only allows you to work on one line of code at a time, a notebook allows you to write code within \"cells\" and to execute these chunks of code cell-by-cell. In the first cell, write the lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "then press `<SHIFT>+<RETURN>`. This will execute all of the code within the given cell (in this instance, assigning the variables `x` and `y` with the values 3 and 4, respectively) and then creates a new cell below. In the next cell type the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "and hit `<SHIFT>+<RETURN>` to execute this code. The number 7 will appear beneath the cell - this, of course, is the value that is returned when `3 + 4` is evaluated: \n",
    "\n",
    "![jupyter notebook example](attachments/jupyter_early.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that the notebook \"knows\" about its variables across its cells. This doesn't just work from top to bottom - you can define `z = 2` in the third cell, and then execute code that references `z` in the first cell. What really matters is the *order* in which the cells are executed. Notice that `In[1]` denotes that the top cell with the first input-cell executed in the notebook, and `In[2]` denotes the second cell that was executed. Formally, the cells within a given notebook share a common \"namespace\" of all the variable names that have been defined in the notebook. Separate notebooks are completely independent from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "A major value of using a notebook is that you can rapidly edit these cells (say, change `x = 3` to  `x = 10`), and re-execute them to nimbly tinker with whatever code you are developing. Although simple, this is a hugely powerful environment for prototyping code. "
