So what distinguishes NumPy's ND-array from a Python list, and why is there a whole numerical library that revolves around this array? There are two major features that makes the ND-array special - it can:\n",

For instance, an array can contain a sequence of 8-bit integers or a sequence of 32-bit floating point numbers, but not a mix of the two. This is in stark contrast to Python's lists (and its other containers), which are entirely unrestricted in the variety of contents they can possess; a given list could simultaneously contain strings, integers, floats, and other objects. This restriction on an array's contents comes at a great benefit - in \"knowing\" that an array's contents are homogenous in data type, NumPy is able to delegate the task of performing mathematical operations on the array's contents to optimized compiled C code, which is a process that is referred to as **vectorization**. The outcome of this can be a *tremendous* speedup relative to the analgous computation performed in Python, which painstakingly check the data type of *every* one of the array's items as it encounters it.    \n",
