    "## Introducing the `reshape` Function\n",
    "NumPy provides an extremely valuable function, `reshape`, which allows you to change the dimensionality and axis-layout of a given array. This adjusts the indexing interface used to access the array's underlying data, as was discussed in eariler in this module. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will be making heavy use of the `arange` function here so that we can easily create arrays of a specified length and with distinct elements; that being said, there is nothing special about `arange`; reshaping works on NumPy arrays contructed in any fashion. Let's take a shape-(6,) array, and reshape it to a shape-(2, 3) array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",

    ">>> np.arange(6).reshape(2, 3)\n",
    "array([[0, 1, 2],\n",
    "       [3, 4, 5]])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the size the the initial array must match the size of the to-be reshaped array:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# an array with 5 numbers are cannot be reshaped\n",
    "# into a (3, 2) array\n",
    ">>> np.arange(5).reshape(3, 2)\n",
    "ValueError: total size of new array must be unchanged\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Multidimensional arrays can be reshaped too:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4)\n",
    ">>> x\n",

    "Because the size of an input array and the resulting reshaped array must agree, you can specify *one* of the dimension-sizes in the reshape function to be -1, and this will cue NumPy to compute that dimension's size for you.

    "## How to Traverse an Array: Row-major (C) vs Column-major (F) Traversal Ordering\n",
    "There is not a unique ordering for a `reshape` function to adhere to. For example, `np.arange(6).reshape(3, 2)` could sensibly return:\n",

    "Both arrays are of the appropriate shape and preserve the ordering of the original sequence of numbers, depending on how you traverse them. The left array preserves the ordering of the original data if you traverse the columns within a row, and then proceed to the next row. This is known as **row-major** ordering. The array on the right preserves the ordering if you traverse the rows within a given column, and then transition to the next column. This is thus referred to as **column-major** ordering. One ordering is no better than the other, that being said, NumPy always defaults to row-major ordering whenever one of its functions involves array traversal.\n",

    "These two orderings are simple enough to follow for a 2D-array, but how do they manifest in arrays with higher dimensions, where we have to worry not only about rows and columns, but potentially \"stacks of sheets with rows and columns\" (which would be a 4D array) and so on? The generic rules are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row-major ordering (C ordering) {NumPy's default}**: traverse an array by advancing the index of the *last axis*, first, until the end of that axis is reached, and then advance the index of the second-to last axis, and so on.\n",

    "\"Row-major\" ordering is also referred to as \"C-ordering\" because this is the traversal method utilized in the C language. \"Column-major\" ordering, on the other hand, is also referred to as \"F-ordering\", because it is used by the Fortran language. NumPy functions, like `reshape` allow you to specify either `order=\"C\"` (which is the default) or `order=\"F\"` to control the order in which an array is traversed; these options thus correspond to row-major and column-major ordering. \n",

    "  1. Create an empty array of the desired shape: (2, 3, 4).\n",

    "  3. Advance the index by *increasing the index of the last axis, first*, and inserting the following element from the input array.\n",
