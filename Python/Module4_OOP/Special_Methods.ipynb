    "# Special Methods\n",
    "In this section we will learn about a variety of instance methods that are reserved by Python, which affect an object's high level behavior and its interactions with operators. These are known as special methods. `__init__` is an example of a special method; recall that it controls the process of creating instances of a class. Similarly, we will see that `__add__` controls the behavior of an object when it is operated on by the `+` symbol, for example. Learning to leverage special methods will enable us to design elegant and powerful classes of objects,\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the names of special methods take the form of `__<name>__`, where the two underscores proceed and succeed the name. Accordingly, special methods can also be referred to as \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of special methods, which would require us to reach beyond our desired level of sophistication. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) provides a rigorous but somewhat inaccessible treatment of special methods. [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/special-method-names.html) has an excellent appendix on special methods. It is strongly recommended that readers consult this resource."

    "## String-Representations of Objects\n",

    "Under the hood, the special method `x.__repr__` is being called to obtain this string representation. The method returns the string `\"['a', 1, True]\"`, which is then printed out to the console. This is an extremely useful for creating classes whose objects can be inspected conveniently in a python console or in a Jupyter notebook. Similarly `__str__` returns the string that will be produced when `str` is called on the object.\n",
