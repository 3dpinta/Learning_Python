    "# Special Methods\n",
    "In this section we will learn about a variety of instance methods that are reserved by Python, which affect an object's high level behavior and its interactions with operators. These are known as special methods. `__init__` is an example of a special method; recall that it controls the process of creating instances of a class. Similarly, we will see that `__add__` controls the behavior of an object when it is operated on by the `+` symbol, for example. Learning to leverage special methods will enable us to design elegant and powerful classes of objects,\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the names of special methods take the form of `__<name>__`, where the two underscores proceed and succeed the name. Accordingly, special methods can also be referred to as \"dunder\" (double-underscore) methods. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This section is not meant to be a comprehensive treatment of special methods, which would require us to reach beyond our desired level of sophistication. The [official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#special-method-names) provides a rigorous but somewhat inaccessible treatment of special methods. [Dive into Python 3](http://www.diveintopython3.net/special-method-names.html) has an excellent appendix on special methods. It is strongly recommended that readers consult this resource."

    "You may be wondering why division has the peculiar name `__truediv__`, whereas the other operators have more sensible names. This is an artifact of the transition from Python 2 to Python 3; [the default integer-division was replaced by float-division](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html#Number-Types), and thus `__div__` was replaced by `__truediv__` for the sake of 2-3 compatibility.
