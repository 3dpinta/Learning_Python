    "# Instances of a Class\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far we have learned about the syntax for defining a new class of object, specifying its name, attributes, and methods (which are attributes that are functions). The resulting *class object* is the singular object that encapsulates our class definition. We seldom will want to pass around or manipulate this class object once it is created. Rather, we will want to use it to create individual *instances* of that class. To be more concrete, `list` is a class object (remember that \"class\" and \"type\" are synonymous) - it is the same sort of object that is produced when a `class` definition is executed. As you saw in [Module 2](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html#Lists), we can use this class object to create individual *instances* of the list class, each one containing its own sequence of items.\n",

    "[]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> list((1, 2, 3))\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "\n",
    "# `a` and `b` are distinct instances of the list class/type\n",
    "# even though they contain the same sequence of integers\n",
    ">>> a = list((1, 2, 3))\n",
    ">>> b = list((1, 2, 3))\n",
    ">>> a is b\n",
    "False\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> isinstance(a, list)\n",
    "True\n",

    ">>> isinstance(b, list)\n",

    "# Calling the append method on `a` only affects that particular \n",
    "# list-instance.\n",
    ">>> a.append(-1)\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, -1]\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> b\n",
    "[1, 2, 3]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these instances share the common attributes `append`, `count`, `reverse`, and so on, as specified in the definition of Python's list class, which is encapsulated by the `list` class object. That being said, the specific content of any given list is an attribute of that particular list instance; that is, the content of a particular list is an *instance attribute* rather than a class attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus far, we only know how to define class-level attributes and produce a class object. Here we will learn about creating *instances* from our own class objects and how to define instance-specific attributes. Suppose, for example, we want to make our own `Person` class, and each person should have a name. We will learn to define a special \"init\" method for our class, that allows us to define and set instance-level attributes. In the context of `Person`, this will allow us to give each person their own name:\n",
