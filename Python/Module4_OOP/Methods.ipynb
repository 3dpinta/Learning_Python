    "Recall that a method is an attribute of a class that is callable (i.e. it is a function). For example, \"append\" is a method that is defined for the `list` class and \"capitalize\" is a method of the `str` (string) class. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# create an instance of the `list` class/type\n",
    "# and invoke the instance method `append`\n",
    ">>> a = [1, 2, 3]\n",
    ">>> a.append(-1)\n",
    ">>> a\n",
    "[1, 2, 3, -1]\n",
    "\n",
    "# create an instance of the `str` class/type\n",
    "# and invoke the instance method `capitalize`\n",
    ">>> b = \"moo\"\n",

    "Here we will encounter three varieties of methods,\n",
    "\n",
    "- instance methods\n",
    "- class methods\n",
    "- static methods\n",
    "\n",
    "whose differences are relatively minor but are important to understand. The \"append\" and \"capitalize\" are both examples of instance methods, specifically, as they must be invoked by a particular list instance and string instance, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have already worked with the instance method `__init__`, which is special in that it is reserved by Python to be executed whenever class-initialization is invoked. Similarly, the special instance method `__add__` informs how an object interacts with the `+` operator. For example, `+` instructs `float` instances to sum their values, as determined by `float.__add__`, whereas `+` concatenates `list` instances. We will conclude our discussion of methods by surveying a number of these special methods - they will greatly bolster our ability to define convenient, user-friendly classes."

    "An *instance method* is defined whenever a function definition is specified within the body of a class. This may seem trivial, but there is still a nuance that must be cleared up, which is that `self` is the defacto first-argument for any instance method. This is something that we encountered when working with `__init__`. Let's first proceed naively so that we will hit a very common error. We will create a class with an instance method that simply accepts an argument and then returns that argument unchanged:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class Dummy():\n",
    "    def func(x): \n",
    "        \"\"\" Returns `x` unchanged. \n",
    "            This is a bad version of this instance method!\"\"\"\n",
    "        return x\n",
    "```   \n",
    "\n",
    "We can call this method from the class object `Dummy` itself, and it will behave as-expected:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> Dummy.func(2)\n",
    "2\n",

    ">>> inst = Dummy()\n",
    ">>> inst.func(2)\n",
    "TypeError: func() takes 1 positional argument but 2 were given\n",
    "```\n",
    "At first glance, this error message doesn't seem to make any sense. Indeed `func` only accepts one argument - we specified that it should accept the argument `x` in its function definition. In what way is `inst.func(2)` specifying *two* arguments? It seems like we are solely passing it the object `2`. Herein lies an extremely important detail:\n",

    ">>> out = inst.func()\n",
    ">>> inst is out\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that this \"under the hood\" behavior only occurs when the method is being called from an *instance*; this is why we didn't face this issue when invoking `func` from `Dummy` - `Dummy` is a class object, not an instance. Thus, `inst.func()` is effectively equivalent to `Dummy.func(inst)`:\n",
