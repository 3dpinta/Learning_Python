    "# Introduction to Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first foray into the essentials of Python introduced us to the [basic object types: numbers, strings, and lists](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html). Likewise, our discussion of NumPy was centered around the [N-dimensional array](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module3_IntroducingNumpy/IntroducingTheNDarray.html). These objects are distinguished in large part by the different functions that are bound to them. Functions bound to objects are known as **methods**. For example, where strings have methods designed to manipulate sequences of characters, a numpy array possesses methods for operating on numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Different types of objects can possess different methods \n",
    "\n",
    ">>> string = \"hello world\"\n",
    ">>> string.capitalize() # use the string-method `capitalize`\n",
    "'Hello world'\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> import numpy as np\n",
    ">>> array = np.array([[0, 1, 2],\n",
    "...                   [3, 4, 5]])\n",
    ">>> array.sum()  # use the array-method `sum`\n",
    "15\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },

   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Similarly, an object can possess data, known as **attributes**, which summarize information about that object. For example, the array-attributes `ndim` and `shape` provide information about the indexing-layout of that array's numerical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# accessing an object's attributes\n",
    ">>> array.ndim\n",
    "2\n",
    ">>> array.shape\n",
    "(2, 3)\n",
    "```"
   ]

    "In this module, we will learn to define our own, customized object types with distinct collections of attributes and methods. In this way, we will be using Python as an \"objected oriented\" programming language; this will greatly expand our capabilities, as Python users, and deepen our understanding of the language itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving forward, we will discuss the essential *class definition*, which will permit us to  define our own class (or type) of object. Next, we will learn about creating distinct *instances* of a given object type. This will lead to our first encounter with *special methods*, which enable us to affect how our object type behaves with Python's various operators. For example, we can define how the `+` operator interacts with our objects. Lastly, we will briefly discuss the concept of class inheritance. "
