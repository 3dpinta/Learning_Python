In Python, \"object\" is quite the catch-all term; including numbers, strings, lists, functions - a Python object is essentially anything that you can assign a variable to. The different types of objects naturally have different uses and different built-in functions available to them. Here, we will review some of the most common object types that are built-in to Python:\n",

The computer will not be able to reliably represent a number's digits beyond those accounted for by the allotted 8 bytes. For instance, the following Python integer is defined with 23 digits, but when this number is converted to a  float, it only retains 16 decimal places in scientific notation:  \n",
    "```python\n",

    "The computer cannot keep track of those last 6 decimal places, because doing so would require more than 8 bytes of memory to store the entire value of that float. As such, attempting to modify a number in decimal places beyond its numerical precision does not have any effect:\n",

There is also a built-in [fractions module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions), which provides tools for working with exact representations of rational numbers. Although we will not be using them here, is very important to keep in mind that these modules exist and that floating point numbers are not the only way around the number line in Python. \n",
