    "# Basic Python Object Types\n",
    "You will see the term \"object\" be used frequently throughout this text. In Python, \"object\" is quite the catch-all term; including numbers, strings, lists, functions - a Python object is essentially anything that you can assign a variable to. The different types of objects naturally have different uses and different built-in functions available to them. Here, we will review some of essential types that are built-in to Python, as this is an essential starting point for using the language effectively. We will cover:\n",
    "\n",
    "- numbers (integers, floating-point numbers, and complex numbers)\n",
    "- booleans\n",
    "- the \"null\" type\n",
    "- strings\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `isinstance` will allow us to check if an object is of a given type. For example, this code checks if an object is an integer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 1  # assign the variable `x` to the integer-object 1\n",
    "\n",
    "# checking that `x` is an integer\n",
    ">>> isinstance(x, int)\n",

    "\n",
    "In effect, this means that a float can only be represented with a *numerical precision* of approximately 16 decimal places, when that number is written in scientific notation. The computer will not be able to reliably represent a number's digits beyond those accounted for by the allotted 8 bytes. For instance, the following Python integer is defined with 23 digits, but when this number is converted to a  float, it only retains 16 decimal places in scientific notation:  \n",

Furthermore, all arithmetic involving decimal numbers from this module is guaranteed to be *exact*, meaning that `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` would be exactly `0.`. There is also a built-in [fractions module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fractions.html#module-fractions), which provides tools for working with exact representations of rational numbers.

    "The term \"object\" is a catch-all in Python, meaning anything that we can assign a variable to. Objects behave differently from one another according to what \"type\" a given object is. \n",

    "\n",
    "- `int`, `float`, `complex`: the numerical types\n",
    "- `bool`: the boolean type. `True`, `False` are the only boolean-type objects\n",
    "- `NoneType`: the \"null\" type. `None` is *the only object that belongs to this type*.\n",
    "- `str`: the string type. \n",

    "The built-in function `type` permits us to check the type of any object:\n",

    ">>> type(True)\n",

    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = 2 + 3\n",
    ">>> isinstance(x, int)\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "The only exception to this is if you want to check if an object is of the type `NoneType`, since this is only possible if the object is  `None`; thus it is \"cleaner\" to directly check this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = None\n",
    ">>> x is None\n",
    "True\n",
    "```\n",

    "As a final reminder, we saw that that an integer in Python is able to hold a value with arbitrarily-many digits. A floating-point number, on the otherhand, is restricted in the number of \"significant\" digits it can hold. Thus, where it is perfectly fine to check if two integers are exactly equal:\n",
