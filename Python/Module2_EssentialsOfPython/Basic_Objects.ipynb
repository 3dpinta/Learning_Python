    "# Basic Python Object Types\n",
    "You will see the term \"object\" be used frequently throughout this text. In Python, \"object\" is quite the catch-all term; including numbers, strings, lists, functions - a Python object is essentially anything that you assign a variable to. The different types of objects naturally have different uses and different built-in functions available to them. Here, we will review some of the most common object types that are built-in to Python. In a later module, you will learn \"object-oriented\" programming, which will allow you to create your own custom objects!\n",
    "\n",
    "The built-in function `isinstance` will allow us to check if an object is of a given type. For example, this code checks if an object is an integer:\n",

Here are some examples of traditional scientific notation, and their corresponding representation in Python:\n",

    "#### Understanding Numerical Precision\n",
    "Whereas a Python integer can be made to be as large as you'd like, a floating-point number is *limited in the number of digits it can store*. That is, your computer will only use a set amount of memory, 8 bytes (32 bits), to store the value of a floating-point number. \n",
    "\n",
    "In effect, this means that a float can only be represented with a *numerical precision* of approximately 16 decimal places, when the number is written in scientific notation. The computer will not be able to reliably represent a number's digits beyond those accounted for by the allotted 8 bytes. Notice that the following Python integer can be defined with 23 digits, but as a float represented in scientific notation, it only retains 16 decimal places. The computer cannot keep track of those last 6 decimal places, because doing so would require more than 8 bytes of memory to store the entire value of that float. \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Demonstrating the finite-precision of a float.\n",
    "# An integer with 23 digits.\n",
    ">>> 18181818181818181818181\n",

    "# 16 decimal places, when written in scientific\n",
    "# notation.\n",
    ">>> float(18181818181818181818181)\n",
    "1.8181818181818182e+22\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Attempting to modify a number in decimal places beyond its numerical precision does not have any effect:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# changing a float beyond its precision has no effect \n",
    ">>>  1. + 1e-16\n",
    "1.0\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in light of the preceding discussion on float precision, you may be shocked and dismayed to see the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the finite-precision of floats \n",
    "# result in non-obvious behavior\n",
    ">>> 0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3 == 0.\n",
    "False\n",

    "5.551115123125783e-17\n",
    "```\n",
    "This is not a quirk of Python; this is a well-understood aspect of dealing with numbers of finite numerical precision. To accomodate this, to check if two floats are \"equal\", you should check if they are \"close enough in value\".\n",
    "Let me emphasize this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You should never check to see if two floats are exactly equal in value. Instead, you should only check that two floats are approximately equal to one another**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `math` module has a very nice function for this; `math.isclose` will check if the relative difference between two numbers is less than $1 \\times 10^{-9}$. You can change this tolerance value, and the type of tolerance that is checked by the function; see its documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/math.html#math.isclose). Because in the previous example we comparing values that are close to 0, we see if their absolute difference is sufficiently small:\n",

    "True\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you do not heed this warning, it is very likely that you will end up with serious, hard-to-find bugs in your code. Lastly,\n",
    "when doing numerical work in Python (and any other programming language), you must understand that the finite numerical precision of floating-point numbers is a source of error, akin to error associated with imprecision with a measuring device, and should be accounted for in your analysis (if error analysis warranted at all).\n",
    "\n",
    "Python's [decimal module](https://docs.python.org/3.0/library/decimal.html) can be used if you need to define higher (or lower) precision numbers than permitted by the standard 8-byte floats. Furthermore, all arithmetic involving decimal numbers from this module is guaranteed to be *exact*, meaning that `0.1 + 0.1 + 0.1 - 0.3` would be exactly `0.`. It is very good to keep in mind that this module exists and that floating point numbers are not the only way around the number line in Python. \n",
