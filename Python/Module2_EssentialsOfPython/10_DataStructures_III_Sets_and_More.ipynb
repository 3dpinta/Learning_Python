    "# Section 10: Data Structures Part III - Sets & the Collections Module\n",
    "## The \"Set\" Data Structure\n",
    "**The Python \"set\" is an *unordered* collection of *unique*, *immutable* objects.** Similar to a dictionary's keys, checking to see if an object is a member of a given set is a $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operation - the time required to check for membership does not depend on the size of the set. Furthermore, this data structure supports set-algebra operations for comparing sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a set\n",
    "You can initialize a set using the syntax: `{item1, item2, ...}`. Please note that this is distinct from the the dictionary-initialization syntax, which uses a colon to indicate key-value pairs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initializing a set containing various immutable objects\n",
    ">>> {1, 3.4, \"apple\", False, (1, 2, 3)}\n",
    "{False, 1, (1, 2, 3), 3.4, 'apple'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "A set can be constructed using the generator-comprehension syntax:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# initialization via set-comprehension\n",
    ">>> {i**2 for i in range(5) if i != 3}\n",
    "{0, 1, 4, 16}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "And, like the `list`, `tuple`, and `dict` constructors, `set` constructs a set from an iterable. **You must use `set()` if you want to create an empty set**, using `{}` creates an empty *dictionary*:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# using `set` to consume an iterable to construct a set\n",
    ">>> set(range(4))\n",
    "{0, 1, 2, 3}\n",
    "\n",
    "# creating an empty set\n",
    ">>> set()  # specifying `{}` would create an empty *dictionary*\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Redundant items are \"ignored\" when constructing or adding to a set. Thus **constructing a set is a great way to extract the unique items from a collection**: \n",
    "```python\n",
    "# filter repeat-items from a collection by feeding it into a set\n",
    ">>> x = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, \"moo\", \"moo\"]\n",
    ">>> set(x)\n",
    "{1, 2, 'moo'}\n",
    "```"
   ]
  },

    "### Set operations\n",
    "Sets support membership-checking, which is an $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ operation, along with iteration. Note that sets are unordered, thus the order of iteration is effectively random:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# checking membership in a set\n",
    ">>> 2 in {1, 2, 3}\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "# iterating over a set (the order of iteration is random)\n",
    ">>> [i for i in {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\"}]\n",
    "['b', 'c', 'a']\n",
    "```\n",
    "Python also provides the set-theoretic operations of union, intersection, and the relations of set equality and set inclusion. These can be invoked using operator symbols or by calling functions on the set explicitly. \n",
    "\n",
    "For an exhaustive list of the functions available to the set, please [refer to the official Python documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#set-types-set-frozenset).\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> x = {\"a\", \"b\", \"c\", \"d\"}\n",
    ">>> y = {\"a\", \"b\", \"e\"}\n",
    "\n",
    "# union: items in x or y, or both\n",
    ">>> x | y  # or x.union(y)\n",
    "{'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# intersection: items in both x and y\n",
    ">>> x & y  # or x.intersection(y)\n",
    "{'a', 'b'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# difference: items in x but not in y\n",
    ">>> x - y  # or x.difference(y)\n",
    "{'c', 'd'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# symmetric difference: in x or y, but not in both\n",
    ">>> x ^ y  # or x.symmetric_difference\n",
    "{'c', 'd', 'e'}\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if set_1 is a superset of set_2\n",
    ">>> {1, 2, 3, 4} >= {1, 2}\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    "# check if set_1 and set_2 are equivalent sets\n",
    ">>> {1, 2, 3, 4} == {1, 2}\n",
    "False\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A set is a *mutable* object - it can be updated after it was created:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# sets are mutable\n",
    ">>> x.add(\"dog\")\n",
    ">>> x.remove(\"a\")\n",
    ">>> x\n",
    "{'b', 'c', 'd', 'dog'}\n",
    "```\n",
    "Because it is mutable, a set cannot be used as a dictionary-key, nor can a set be a member of another set. Python provides an immutable version of the set, `frozenset`, which has all of the functions of a set other than those that mutate the set:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# `frozenset` is an immutable version of a Python set\n",
    ">>> frozenset(x)\n",
    "frozenset({'b', 'c', 'd', 'dog'})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> \n",
    "**Takeaway**: Python's set is an unordered collection of unique, immutable objects. It is an excellent tool for extracting the unique members from a collection of items. The set provides  $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ membership-checking along with a suite of set-algebra operations for comparing sets. `frozenset` is an immutable version of the set.\n",

    "#### Named-Tuple\n",
