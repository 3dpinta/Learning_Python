    "## Problem 1: `merge_max_mappings`\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's suppose that we have two dictionaries that we want to merge together. However, these dictionaries contain some duplicate values, so in order to merge them without any conflicts we want to save the maximum value from each dictionary. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> dict1 = {'bananas':7, 'apples':3, 'pears':14}\n",
    ">>> dict2 = {'bananas':3, 'apples':6, 'grapes':9}\n",
    ">>> merge_max_mappings(dict1, dict2)\n",
    "{'bananas': 7, 'apples': 6, 'pears': 14, 'grapes': 9}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a function that accepts two dictionaries and returns a dictionary with all of the elements of the input dicts, but with the maximum value mapped to any duplicate values. Be sure to test this function, and make sure that it doesn't modify any of the input dictionaries!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra Challenges**\n",
    "- Try optimizing this function. Is it iterating over both of the dictionaries, or just one? Which one is it iterating over? What's the runtime complexity? Look back and see if you've made it as fast as possible.\n",
    "- What if you wanted to use something other than the maximum value? Try rewriting the function to work for conditions other than maximum (minimum value, sum of the two values, etc.)\n",
    "- As an extension of the above function, try making this function able to generalize to any condition for which value to save. Remember, you can pass functions into other functions!"

    "## Solution 1: `merge_max_mappings`\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic solution to the first part of the problem, without extra challenges, is as follows.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def merge_max_mappings(dict1, dict2):\n",
    "  #create a return dictionary, as not to modify any of the input dictionaries.\n",
    "  ret = dict1.copy()\n",
    "  #iterates over the keys in the second dictionary \n",
    "  for i in dict2:\n",
    "    #if the value is already in the dictionary but it's not the maximum, reassign it\n",
    "    #if it's not in the dictionary, assign it.\n",
    "    if i not in ret or dict2[i] > dict1[i]:\n",
    "      ret[i] = dict2[i]\n",
    "  return ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "This simple solution uses the first dictionary as a baseline, then iterates over the second dictionary to update all of the values. Though this solution is already rather optimized, it can be improved on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra Challenge 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "The optimized solution is as follows:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def merge_max_mappings(dict1, dict2):\n",
    "  #Assigns the values such that ret is the longer dictionary and other is the shorter dictionary.\n",
    "  if len(dict1) > len(dict2):\n",
    "    ret = dict1.copy()\n",
    "    other = dict2.copy()\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    ret = dict2.copy()\n",
    "    other = dict1.copy()\n",
    "  \n",
    "  #iterates over the keys in other\n",
    "  for i in other:\n",
    "    #if the value is already in ret, but it's not the maximum, reassign it. \n",
    "    #if it's not in ret, assign it also.\n",
    "    if i not in ret or other[i] > ret[i]:\n",
    "      ret[i] = other[i]\n",
    "  return ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "Although this optimization likely won't speed up our test cases, when our dictionaries begin to grow in size this optimization could save a lot of time. Imagine if our dictionaries were of lengths 5000 and 10000, respectively. Our little optimization here could save us from 5000 more iterations through this dictionary! This isn't a huge optimization, but it changes the functions complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(len(dict1))$ to $\\mathcal{O}(min(len(dict1))), len(dict2)))$. Of course, this still simplifies down to $\\mathcal{O}(n)$, but it is still marginally faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are, of course, ways to oprimize this further, but they are beyond the scope of this course, and it is not possible to optimize this function to a lower complexity than $\\mathcal{O}(n)$. If you want to see an even faster version, a great (but complex) implementation is shown [here.](https://github.com/rsokl/MyGrad/blob/9c7e22e954ce7f2bb141b5596bba0dfd15c1a574/mygrad/linalg/ops.py#L91)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Extra Challenge 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a huge variety of ways to decide what value to use in the dictionary. As with Extra Challenge 2, it is possible to code as many of these as you'd like by hand, but a more practical and general solution does exist!\n",
    "```python\n",
    "#Accepts the dictionaries, and an optional function argument.\n",
    "def merge_mappings(dict1, dict2, key = max):\n",
    "  #This is the same as covered in Extra Challenge 1\n",
    "  if len(dict1) > len(dict2):\n",
    "    ret = dict1.copy()\n",
    "    other = dict2.copy()\n",
    "  else:\n",
    "    ret = dict2.copy()\n",
    "    other = dict1.copy()\n",
    "  \n",
    "  for i in other:\n",
    "    #If it's not in ret, put it into ret.\n",
    "    if i not in ret:\n",
    "      ret[i] = other[i]\n",
    "    #If it is in ret, run it through the key function and give the output of that.\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "      ret[i] = key(ret[i], other[i])\n",
    "  return ret\n",
    "```\n",
    "The key argument for this function allows us to specify any funcion with which to decide the value to pick. This input could be specified as `min`, `sum`, or any other function, even ones that we define ourselves. In this way, we can leave the choice of which value to use up to the user, but still default to the maximum value if nothing is specified."
