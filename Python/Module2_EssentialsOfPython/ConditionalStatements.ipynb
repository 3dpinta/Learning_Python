For example, in computer science, the number 0 is often associated with `False` and non-zero numbers are associated with `True`. Python ascribes most of its built-in objects with inherent boolean values, which can be evaluated with the built-in Python command `bool`. For example, the Python integer 0 is ascribed the boolean value `False`:\n",
