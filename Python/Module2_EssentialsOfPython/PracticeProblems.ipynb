    "We will naturally tackle this problem by performing nested for-loops. The outermost for-loop will loop over each number in the list, we will refer to this number as the \"base number\". We will want the inner for-loop to iterate ahead of the base number so that we can compute the difference of it and its $n_{fanout}$ neighbors. We will need to take care re-initialize our intermediate list of differences for each new base number, otherwise each subtraction will get appended to one long list. \n",

    "    return all_fanouts\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note our use of [enumerate](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html#Enumerating-iterables); this permits us to simultaneously access our base number, which we use in the subtraction, as well as its index-position within the list `l`, which we use to determine the neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you may be concerned that our inner-loop will attempt to iterate beyond the end of the list. Consider the case in which `base_number` is the final element in `l`, thus `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` would be equivalent to `l[len(l): len(l)+fanout]` - the stopping point for this slice clearly reaches beyond the extent of `l` (assuming `fanout > 0`). Fortunately, this is not an oversight on our part. While indexing a list outside of its bounds will raise an error, recall that [a slice will automatically limit itself to be within bounds of a given sequence](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/SequenceTypes.html#Handling-out-of-bounds-indices). That is, `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` actually behaves like `l[max(0, i+1): min(len(l), i+1+fanout)]` (assuming we are dealing only with positive indices). Thus our inner-loop will naturally limit itself to only look ahead as far as it can. In the case that `base_number` is the final element in `l`, the inner-loop will exit immediately, leaving `base_fanout` empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a somewhat obscure but important point to remember about how slicing works in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: difference_fanout using list comprehensions\n",
    "We can make judicious use of nested [list comprehensions](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Generators_and_Comprehensions.html#List-&-Tuple-Comprehensions) to simplify our solution.

    "There are fewer potential points of failure in this solution, as its conciseness removes the \"moving parts\" that had to be managed in the previous solution. This should help demonstrate the power of the comprehension expression syntax.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Extension\n",
    "Recall from [earlier](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Functions-are-Objects) that functions are, under the hood, just objects with some special operations that allow you to \"call\" a function. This means that you can pass other functions as parameters into our function. It is especially powerful since it enables us to generalize the purposes of our functions. For example, we don't have to limit our function to just computing the **difference** between members and their following terms; we can apply **any** *binary operation*. Instead of finding the difference, we can calculate the sum or product or even concatenate two strings for a list of string. The possibility is limitless. \n",
    "Armed with this knowledge, we can generalize the code.\n",

    "def apply_fanout(l, fanout, op):\n",

    "> Sometimes it is very important to handle different object types of inputs differently in a function. Let's say you're appending a list of objects into one single string. If the object is an integer, convert it into a string by spelling out each digit in base-10 in this format:\n",
    "`142` $\\rightarrow$ `one-four-two`; `-12` $\\rightarrow$ `neg-one-two`. If the object is a float, just append it's integer part (obtained by rounding down) the same way and the string `\"and float\"`:\n",
    "`12.324` $\\rightarrow$ `one-two and float`. If the object is a string, keep it as is. If the object is `None`, switch to a new line. If the object is any other type, return `None`. Each object's transcription in **one line** is separated by `\" | \"`, and the result should be one large string. \n",

    "# example behavior\n",
    ">>> s = concat_to_str([12,-14.23,\"Some magic number\", None,\n",
    ">>>                    \"Aha\", 10.1, 1, 2, None, 5])\n",

    "**Tips**: checkout the `isinstance` function introduced [here](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Basic_Objects.html) for different type handling. Also, consider creating a helper function for the conversion from integer to our special-format string, since we have to do it twice. It's always good to extrapolate repeated tasks into functions. You'll also need to hard-code the conversion from each digit to its English spellout. \n",
