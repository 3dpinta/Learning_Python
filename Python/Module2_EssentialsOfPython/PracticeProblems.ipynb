    "We will naturally tackle this problem by performing nested for-loops. The outermost for-loop will loop over each number in the list. We will refer to this number as the \"base number\". We will want the inner for-loop to iterate ahead of the base number so that we can compute the differences between it and its $n_{fanout}$ neighbors. We will need to take care re-initialize our intermediate list of differences for each new base number, otherwise each subtraction will get appended to one long list. \n",

    "Note our use of [enumerate](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Iterables.html#Enumerating-iterables); this permits us to simultaneously access our base number, which we use in the subtraction, as well as its index-position within the list `l`, which we use to determine the neighbors. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, you may be concerned that our inner-loop will attempt to iterate beyond the end of the list. Consider the case in which `base_number` is the final element in `l`, thus `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` would be equivalent to `l[len(l): len(l)+fanout]` - the stopping point for this slice clearly reaches beyond the extent of `l` (assuming `fanout > 0`). Fortunately, this is not an oversight on our part. While indexing a list outside of its bounds will raise an error, recall that [a slice will automatically limit itself to be within bounds of a given sequence](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/SequenceTypes.html#Handling-out-of-bounds-indices). That is, `l[i+1: i+1+fanout]` actually behaves like `l[min(i, len(l)-1): min(len(l), i+1+fanout)]` (assuming we are dealing only with positive indices and non-empty lists). Thus our inner-loop will naturally limit itself. In the case that `base_number` is the final element in `l`, the inner-loop will exit immediately, leaving `base_fanout` empty. Although somewhat obscure, this is an important aspect of Python's slicing mechanism to keep in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: difference_fanout using list comprehensions\n",
    "We can make judicious use of nested [list comprehensions](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Generators_and_Comprehensions.html#List-&-Tuple-Comprehensions) to simplify our solution.

    "\n",
    "### Extension\n",
    "Recall from [earlier](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Functions-are-Objects) that functions are, under the hood, just objects with some special operations that allow you to \"call\" a function. This means that you can pass other functions as parameters into a function. It is especially powerful, since it enables us to generalize the purposes of our functions. For example, we don't have to limit our function to just computing the **difference** between members and their following terms; we can apply **any** *binary operation*. Instead of finding the difference, we can calculate the sum or product or even concatenate two strings for a list of string. The possibilities are limitless. \n",

    "`int_to_str` plays a clever trick to convert each integer, digit-by-digit, into its string form - it calls `str` on the integer. This converts the integer into a string, which is a [sequence](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/SequenceTypes.html). This permits us to access each digit of the integer and even iterate over them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# casting an integer to a string makes its\n",
    "# sign and digits accessible via indexing/iteration\n",
    ">>> x = str(-123)\n",
    ">>> x\n",
    "'-123'\n",
    ">>> x[0]\n",
    "'-'\n",
    ">>> x[-1]\n",
    "'3'\n",
    "```\n",
    "Thus, in total `\"-\".join(mapping[digit] for digit in str(n))` is responsible for casting an integer to a string, iterating over each of its digits and mapping them to their corresponding word using the [dictionary](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/DataStructures_II_Dictionaries.html) that we defined in the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "`item_to_transcript` it an especially slick function. First, let's make clear the fancy use of the inline syntax here. This function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def item_to_transcript(item):\n",
    "    \"\"\" Any -> str \"\"\"\n",
    "    if isinstance(item, bool): return '<OTHER>'\n",
    "    if isinstance(item, int): return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "    if isinstance(item, float): return int_to_str(int(item)) + \" and float\"\n",
    "    if isinstance(item, str): return item\n",
    "    return '<OTHER>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "is entirely equivalent to this function:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def item_to_transcript_alt(item):\n",
    "    \"\"\" Any -> str \"\"\"\n",
    "    if isinstance(item, bool): \n",
    "        return '<OTHER>'\n",

    "        return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "    elif isinstance(item, float): \n",
    "        return int_to_str(int(item)) + \" and float\"\n",
    "    elif isinstance(item, str): \n",
    "        return item\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        return '<OTHER>'\n",
    "```\n",
    "The latter uses the familiar pattern of [if-elif-else](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/ConditionalStatements.html) statements and makes for a completely satisfactory version of the function. See, however, that each of the [multiple return statements](https://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Multiple-return-Statements) in `item_to_transcript` guarantees the same logic, in that if a condition is meant a value will be returned by the function and none of its subsequent code can be visited. That is, if `item` is an integer the second if-condition will evaluate to `True` and `int_to_str(item)` will be returned, immediately expelling the point of execution from the body of the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ultimately, the preference of one function over the other is merely a matter of stylistic preference. You also have likely noted the peculiar in-line `if-return` expressions. These too are only stylistic choices; \n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(item, int): return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "is no different from\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if isinstance(item, int): \n",
    "    return int_to_str(item)\n",
    "```\n",
    "The use of in-line `if-return` expressions in `item_to_transcript` does a nice job emphasizing the dictionary-like mapping behavior of the function: the form of the code suits its functionality nicely. That being said, these should generally be used sparingly. Some may call this a \"cute\" trick. And it is. This code is cute. I write cute code.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, you may have noticed what looks like a redundancy in our code: our first `if` statement returns `'<OTHER>'` if `item` is `True` or `False`, and our final line of code returns `'<OTHER>'` if none of the preceding conditions were met (i.e. `item` is not a `bool`, `int`, `float`, or `str` type object). Why then did we not just merge our first `if` clause with this ultimate catch-all? The reason is that `True` and `False` are not only instances of the boolean type, they are also integers! `True` behaves like the integer `1` and `False` like `0`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> isinstance(True, int) and isinstance(True, bool)\n",
    "True\n",
    "\n",
    ">>> 3*True + True - False\n",
    "4\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, had we not taken care to check for booleans up front, `True` and `False` would have been mapped to `'one'` and `'zero'`, respectively, rather than `'<OTHER>'`. This is a relatively subtle edge case to catch."
