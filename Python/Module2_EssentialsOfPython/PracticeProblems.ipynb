    "Recall from [earlier](http://www.pythonlikeyoumeanit.com/Module2_EssentialsOfPython/Functions.html#Functions-are-Objects) that functions are, under the hood, just objects with some special operations that allow you to \"call\" a function. This means that you can pass other functions as parameters into our function. It is especially powerful since it enables us to generalize the purposes of our functions. For example, we don't have to limit our function to just computing the **difference** between members and their following terms; we can apply **any** *binary operation*. Instead of finding the difference, we can calculate the sum or product or even concatenate two strings for a list of string. The possibility is limitless. \n",
