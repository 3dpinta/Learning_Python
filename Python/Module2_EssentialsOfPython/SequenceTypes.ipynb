    "# Sequence Types\n",
    "Being able to work with sequences of objects/data is so important that it warrants us to take our first (relatively) deep dive into Python. The preceding reading introduced Python lists and strings, two important objects that are built-in to the Python language. Although quite distinct from one another in terms of what they can contain, *lists and strings are both types of sequences* - they store a finite collection of objects whose ordering matters (e.g. `\"cat\"` and `\"tac\"` should be considered distinct strings). As such, lists, strings, and the other sequence types in Python all share a common interface for allowing users to inspect, retrieve, and summarize their contents.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another common sequence type is the **tuple**. A tuple is very similar to a list, in that it can store a sequence of arbitrary objects (a mix of numbers, strings, lists, other tuples, etc.), however, *once a tuple is formed, it cannot be changed*. This is in stark contrast to a list, whose individual members contents can be added to, removed from, and changed in-place. \n",
    "\n",
    "Where lists are \"created\" with square-brackets, tuples use round-brackets:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# creating a tuple\n",
    ">>> x = (1, \"a\", 2)  # tuple with 3 entries\n",
    "\n",
    "# (3) does not make a tuple with one entry\n",
    "# you must provide a trailing comma in this \n",
    "# instance \n",
    ">>> y = (3,)         # a tuple with 1 entry\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "That a tuple cannot be changed means that it is an **immutable** sequence type (more on this below), as are strings. A list, on the other hand, is a **mutable** sequence type. Tuples generally consume less memory than do lists, since it is known that a tuple will not change in size. Furthermore, tuples come in handy when you want to ensure that a sequence of data cannot be changed by subsequent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# the contents of a list can be changed: it is \"mutable\"\n",
    ">>> x = [1, \"moo\", None] \n",

    "In addition to accepting an integer as an index to a single member of a sequence, the \"get-item\" syntax can also accept the built-in `slice\"` object identify *subsequences* to be retrieved. A slice can be provided with a start-index, a stop-index, and a step-size, to specify the desired subsequence. The item at the start-index is *included* in the subsequence, whereas the item at the stop-index (if there is one) is *excluded*. Negative indices and step-sizes are valid too.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "By default, the start-index is 0, the stop-index is `len(seq)`, and the step-size is 1. Python will revert to any these defaults either if you omit a value or specify the `None` object in the value's place. The second colon need not be included if you are relying on the step-1 default value:\n",
