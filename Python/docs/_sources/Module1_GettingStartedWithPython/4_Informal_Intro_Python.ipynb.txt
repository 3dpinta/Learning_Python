    "# An Informal Introduction to Python\n",
    "Now that you have the Anaconda distribution of Python installed on your machine, and you have some familiarity with the IPython shell and Jupyter notebooks, it is time to learn some of the basics in Python. In this informal introduction you will meet the following learning objectives.\n",

    "<div class=\"alert alert-warning\">\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are reading-comprehension exercises included throughout the text. These are meant to help you put your reading to practice. Solutions for the exercises are included at the bottom of this page.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",

    "## A Quick Guide to Formatting\n",
    "Here is a quick rundown of the formatting that will be used throughout this text.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following represents a block of Python code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# count to 10\n",
    "cnt = 0\n",
    "for i in range(10):\n",
    "    cnt += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `>>>` symbol is used to distinguish Python code that is entered in a terminal (e.g. in the IPython console) from its output:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> print(2 + 3)  # input python code\n",
    "5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Writing Comments in Code\n",
    "The pound-sign, `#`, is used to indicate a comment in Python code. Any text\n",
    "to the right of a `#` wil be treated as a comment, and will not be interpreted as code:\n",
    "```python\n",
    ">>> 2 + 3  # + 4 + 5... this is all a comment, so it has no impact on the code!\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Required Reading\n",
    "Please read the following sections from the official Python tutorial:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Numbers](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator)\n",
    "- [Strings](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#strings)\n",
