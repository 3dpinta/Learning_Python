    "## Integrated Development Environments\n",
    "In Section 1 of this module, we learned that a Python script is simply a text file that contains Python code. Beyond typically using a `.py` suffix for the filename, there is nothing that differentiates this sort of file from any other text file. That being said, it is not a good idea to use a simple text editor to write Python code (and it is a **terrible** idea to use word-processing software, like Microsoft Word, to do so). Insted we want an \"integrated development environment\" (IDE) that will facilitate our code writing. \n",
    "\n",
    "First and foremost, a good IDE will provide a text editor that will:\n",
    "- check your code for syntax errors (a misspelled function name, a reference to an undefined variable, etc)\n",
    "- colorize your code so that it is easy to distinguish, for instance, numbers from character strings.\n",
    "- enable you to easily look up documentation and definitions for functions that you are using.\n",
    "- autocomplete the names of variables and functions as you are typing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An IDE also often provides debugging tools so that you can test your code; it will also typically interface with version-control software, like Git, so that you can keep track of versions of your code as you modify it. We will not discuss these useful, but more advanced features here.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recommended IDEs\n",
    "There are many excellent IDEs that can be configured to work well with Python. Two IDEs that we endorse are:\n",
    " 1. [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download): A powerful IDE dedicated to Python.\n",
    "   - Pros: \n",
    "     - works well out-of-the-box\n",
    "     - supported by professionals and thus is very reliable\n",
    "     - highly configurable\n",
    "     - fully-featured\n",
    "   - Cons:\n",
    "     - can be resource-heavy, especially for a laptop\n",
    "     - may be overwhelming to new users (but has good documentation and tutorials)\n",
    " 2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the [Python extension](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/python): A lightweight, highly customizable IDE.\n",
    "   - Pros:\n",
    "     - a lightweight and elegant \n",
    "     - works with many different languages, so you only need to familiarize yourself with one IDE\n",
    "     - a huge number of extensions can be downloaded to add functionality to the editor, these are created by a large community of open-source developers.\n",
    "   - Cons:\n",
    "     - currently less polished and powerful than PyCharm\n",
    "     - can require some tinkering to get features working\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\"> \n",
    "**Takeaway**: Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) provide powerful tools for helping you write well-formatted and typo-free code. We recommend using PyCharm Community Edition or Visual Studio Code (with the Python extension installed) for your Python IDE. \n",

    "## The Python Console\n",
    "It is slow to tinker with Python code by writing a script and then executing it. Instead, a simple way to try out Python is to open a Python \"console\" in your terminal. To do so, open your computer's terminal (cmd.exe in Windows) and simply type: python. You should see something like:\n",

You just executed some Python code! A console session has \"memory\" of the commands that you type. For instance, if you run the line of code `x = 5` in the console, then the variable `x` will reference the value 5 until you close this console session (or you delete or reassign `x`). \n",

This autocompletion works with any defined Python variables or function names, including ones that you have defined yourself. Writing code is greatly expedited by autocompletion. This is also useful when you can't remember the exact name of a variable hitting `<TAB>` will bring up a list of possible variable names, given what you have typed.\n",

This greatly enhances the readability of code. \n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a \"notebook server\" that is running on your machine - it basically handles all of the communication between your browser and your machine. A new window or tab should open in your web browser, which looks like a file explorer. You can use this to enter subdirectories and to open up any Jupyter notebooks that you have saved.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the top-right corner of this window, click on the dropdown menu labeled \"New\", and select the option `Python [conda root]`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Notebook Cells \n",
    "Whereas a Python console only allows you to work on one line of code at a time, a notebook allows you to write code within \"cells\" and to execute these chunks of code cell-by-cell. In the first cell, write the lines of code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x = 3\n",
    "y = 4\n",
    "```\n",
    "then press `<SHIFT>+<RETURN>`. This will execute all of the code within the given cell (in this instance, assigning the variables `x` and `y` with the values 3 and 4, respectively) and then creates a new cell below. In the next cell type the code:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "x + y\n",
    "```\n",
    "and hit `<SHIFT>+<RETURN>` to execute this code. The number 7 will appear beneath the cell - this, of course, is the value that is returned when `3 + 4` is evaluated. Notice that the notebook \"knows\" about its variables across its cells. This doesn't just work from top to bottom - you can define `z = 2` in the third cell, and then execute code that references `z` in the first cell. Formally, the cells within a given notebook share a common \"namespace\" of all the variable names that have been defined in the notebook. Separate notebooks are completely independent from one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "The value of the notebook environment is that you can rapidly edit these cells (say, change `x = 3` to  `x = 10`), and re-execute them to nimbly tinker with whatever code you are developing. Although simple, this is a hugely powerful environment for prototyping code. \n",

    "\n",
    "### Notebooks for Visualizing Data and Sharing Information\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks can do much more than run Python code. They can be used to render HTML and Markdown (a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text with some stylized elements). You can embed images, videos, and audio in notebooks, and plots of data render nicely beneath cells. This functionality has made Jupyter notebooks wildly popular for use among data scientists, researchers, and other people who want to create, analyze, and share numerical results with one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, every cell is in \"Code\" mode - it expects Python code, and will run any code within it. The cell can also be set to \"Markdown\" mode. Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write plain text with some stylized elements. If you ever want to write a substantial amount of documentation or explanation about your code, you can set a cell to Markdown mode and type in it as if it were a text editor. \"Running\" a markdown cell will render the text you wrote.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Note: if you ever find that your Python code isn't being formatted properly, and doesn't run at all (you get no output, not even errors), there is a good chance that you accidentally set the cell to 'Markdown' mode! Change it back to 'Code' mode.\n",

    "### Some Bells and Whistles\n",
    "Jupyter notebook provides nice, basic utilities for editing code:\n",
    "- Autocompletion (hit `<TAB>` as you are typing in a defined function or variable name) \n",
    "- Color-coding built-in functions, strings of characters, and numbers\n",
    "- Bringing up documentation for functions\n",
    "    - In a cell (set to Code mode), type `sum` and then press `<SHIFT>+<TAB>` when your text cursor is still on `sum`. \n",
    "    - This will bring up the documentation for the built-in Python function sum. \n",
    "    - `<SHIFT>-<TAB>-<TAB>` (holding SHIFT, tap TAB twice) will open an extended window to show the full documentation. \n",
    "    - This works with any function that has a \"docstring\" defined for it - even ones that you write yourself. This is an excellent way to quickly look up the documentation for any function/object in Python.  Pressing ESC will close the windo"
