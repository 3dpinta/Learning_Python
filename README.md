This is Sam Carpenter(CogWorks 2k18)'s branch where he adds practice problems to PLYMI! He's already doing that merging dicionaries one that Ryan mentioned, but honestly this man is crazy and we have no idea what else he might add!

This site is written primarily in Jupyter notebooks, which are transformed into html using [nbsphinx](https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.4/). The positive aspect of this is that you simply need to be familiar with Jupyter notebooks and some [markdown syntax](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) in order to contribute to this project!

**NOTE**: This content is not meant for public release. If you are reading this, then I have added you as a contributor to this project. Please do not distribute this work to others.

# Python Like You Mean It
This repository contains the source material for the website [Python Like You Mean It](pythonlikeyoumeanit.com). It is not yet at 1.0 (stable public release). See the issues section to find tasks that need doing. Please share this website with others, but not this source material. This is a private repo, and I have added people in good faith that they will not distribute the source material.
 
# How To Contribute
Contributions to this project are very welcome!  I will be sure to credit any/all contributions (unless your want to remain anonymous). Some great ways to help out are to:
- proofread 
- add reading comprehension exercises to existing sections
- provide general feedback about the organization of the website, the consistency of the material, etc.
- create lengthier standalone problems to serve as holistic examples of how to apply the concepts presented in the reading 
 
You can either open an issue to provide feedback or point out errors, or you can create a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/)) if you want to submit new/modified materials. The other maintainers of PLYMI and I are happy to help you refine your issues and PRs, so please do not be discouraged if you are new to Git/GitHub.

I have posted a number of "To-Do" tasks in this project's [issues](https://github.com/LLrsokl/BWSI_2018/issues) page, and I will be adding to these as this project progresses. Included are requests for proofreading and exercises. Please post within an issue if you are working on a to-do item, so multiple people don't end up working on the same task. General feedback on content is also hugely valuable, so feel free to open a new issue to provide your feedback on any of the material.

[Here is a nice Markdown "cheat sheet"](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet) for looking up how to make tables, code-blocks, etc., in Markdown.
