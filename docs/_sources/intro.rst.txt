Essentials of Python, for Data Science Applications
===================================================
The following is a collection of modules geared to introduce certain core elements of the Python programming language and the NumPy library in a concise manner. These elements are selected to include the tools and "tricks" that are most important for numerical and data science applications, while still conveying a solid understanding of the Python language itself. A specific audience that I have in mind are high school students who are interested in participating in the `Beaver Works Summer Institute <https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/bwsi>`_ (BWSI). That is, I want this text to be sufficient for talented/focused high school juniors to teach themselves Python over a couple of months, so that they can begin to tackle exciting, real-world problems using applied mathematics (signal processing, machine learning, and other techniques). It is important that these students have a good understanding of the tools that they are using - to merely equip them with a tool belt holding various "black boxes" would be a failure.

There are a number of good books that cover these topics, and a massive number of blog posts in this vein as well, so why bother with this text? In short, some books cover the Python language so extensively that it is not feasible for a novice to discern what parts are "essential", and assigning selected sections for reading is too incoherent and inaccessible for students. Books and courses that focus on "Python for data science" are typically shallow in their treatment of the Python language itself. And lastly, there is the immense, ever-growing collection (dumpster fire) of "how-to" Python blog posts... look, just because you figured out how to write your first decorator doesn't mean you need to speed off to your local starbucks to write a blog post about it. 

All in all, I like to teach, I like to write, and I like Python, so this is a fun project for me to take on. I am building off of my experience teaching the Cog*Works 2017 BWSI course (which was awesome!) to help inform this work.
