Module 5: Odds and Ends
=====================================
This module contains materials that are extraneous to the essentials of Python as a language and of NumPy, but are nonetheless critical to doing day-to-day work using these tools. The first section introduces matplotlib, a library that allows us to plot and visually inspect data. The next section presents the "best practices" for working with files in Python; this includes reading from and writing to files.

More sections will be added to this module down the road.
