Module 2: The Essentials of Python
==================================
This module is designed to introduce you to the essential elements of Python. Here, you will be introduced to the following topics: 

* Become familiar with lists and other sequence type.
* Encounter 'indexing' and 'slicing' for accessing parts of sequences. (**This is very important!**).
* Use a 'while*loop' to compute the first 6 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.
* How to assign variables to values.
* What makes a valid variable name.
* What to expect when multiple variables reference the same object.
* The difference between mutable and immutable objects.
* Execute parts of code only if a user-specified condition is true (using if, else, and elif).
* Repeatedly execute a block of code until a stopping condition is met (using while).
* Iterate over a collection strings, numbers, or other kinds of objects, and execute a block of code for each iteration (using for).
* Control the flow within a for-loop (using break, continue, and else)
* Create an object that is able to efficiently generate a sequence of items, without having to hold them all in memory at once.
* Define functions to encapsulate pieces of code into modular chunks that can be reused elsewhere.

Although far from comprehensive, this module will acquaint you with the many of the essential elements of Python, along with the niceties that make the language easy to use. The objective here is to equip the reader with the tools needed to write clear and efficient code, that is particularly effective for data science applications. It is paramount that writing code in Python does not feel like stacking a bunch "black boxes" together; for this reason, a considerable amount of detail is included here. I hope that a reasonable balance has been struck such that this text is still easy to read and that its key "takeaways" are readily distilled.
